# STA303_Professional_Development
I am setting this repository as a part of my professional development task for my course STA303: Data Exploration-I to show evidence that I know how to setup a Github repo.
As further evidence I cloned the repo to my R studios, added a markdown and R script to the, committed and pushed these changes to the repository and tried other basic git commands.
